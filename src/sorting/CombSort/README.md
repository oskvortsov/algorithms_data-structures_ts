# Comb sort

In bubble sort, when any two elements are compared, they always have a gap (distance from each other) of 1. The basic idea of comb sort is that the gap can be much more than 1. The inner loop of bubble sort, which does the actual swap, is modified such that the gap between swapped elements goes down (for each iteration of outer loop) in steps of a "shrink factor" k: [ n/k, n/k2, n/k3, ..., 1 ].

The gap starts out as the length of the list n being sorted divided by the shrink factor k (generally 1.3; see below) and one pass of the aforementioned modified bubble sort is applied with that gap. Then the gap is divided by the shrink factor again, the list is sorted with this new gap, and the process repeats until the gap is 1. At this point, comb sort continues using a gap of 1 until the list is fully sorted. The final stage of the sort is thus equivalent to a bubble sort, but by this time most turtles have been dealt with, so a bubble sort will be efficient.

## Pseudocode
```
function combsort(array input) is

    gap := input.size // Initialize gap size
    shrink := 1.3 // Set the gap shrink factor
    sorted := false

    loop while sorted = false
        // Update the gap value for a next comb
        gap := floor(gap / shrink)
        if gap â‰¤ 1 then
            gap := 1
            sorted := true // If there are no swaps this pass, we are done
        end if

        // A single "comb" over the input list
        i := 0
        loop while i + gap < input.size // See Shell sort for a similar idea
            if input[i] > input[i+gap] then
                swap(input[i], input[i+gap])
                sorted := false
                // If this assignment never happens within the loop,
                // then there have been no swaps and the list is sorted.
             end if
    
             i := i + 1
         end loop
     end loop
end function
```
